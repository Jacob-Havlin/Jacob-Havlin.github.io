    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
    <p>I am currently a senior enrolled at both Ralston Valley and Warren Tech in the Computer Science program . I deeply value integrity, communication, and hard work. I aspire to work with upcoming technology in the business world. This aspiration has motivated me to pursue degrees in business and computer science.

Prior to the Computer Science program, I was enrolled in the Business Administration program at Warren Tech. I have worked on many school projects involving PMI projects and I have also worked under the NASA HUNCH project to develop them an AI powered diagnoses program for their astronauts in deep space. I strive to learn, gain experience, and apply business knowledge and my understanding of  to the real world.</p>
